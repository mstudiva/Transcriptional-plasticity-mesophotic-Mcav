Library Pool Concentration Protocol

------------------------------
1.	Add 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate and 3 volumes 100% isopropanol. Incubate overnight at
-20°C. (If pool volume > 450 µl, reaction will not fit in 2 mL tube and must be split into replicates.)
2.	Centrifuge 30 minutes at maximum speed, 4°C.
3.	Remove isopropanol by pipetting, pellets are very likely to slide off. Add 150 µl cold 70% ethanol and flick tube gently to wash pellet. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at maximum speed, 4°C.
4.	Remove ethanol with pipette. Dry pellet 10-15’ sitting up in the hood, covered with a kim-wipe. Resuspend in 20 µl NFW (final pool should be 20 µl, so adjust accordingly if performing replicates or need to nanodrop).
5.	Incubate 15-30 minutes at 55°C to resuspend pellet. Transfer into 1.5 mL safelock tube and combine replicates if needed.
